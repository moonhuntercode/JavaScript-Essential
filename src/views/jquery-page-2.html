    Firstly, prototypes are just objects. In this case, yes: <br>

    jQuery.prototype === jQuery.fn<br>
    So saying jQuery.fn.map = function() {} is like saying jQuery.prototype.map = function() {}<br>
    
    When you instantiate a new jquery object with $(selector | dom node | ...) you are returning a jQuery object which automatically inherits all the prototype methods, including map, tweet, etc. Research Javascript's prototypal inheritence model and how object prototypes work in regard to new<br>
    
    $ is just a reference to jQuery which returns a specially modified new object. $ is a function which returns a new object reference. Here's a simplified example (but you really should research more about prototypal inheritence, it has been answered many times repeatedly):<br>
    
    var A = function() {<br>
    };<br>
    
    A.prototype.doThing = function() {<br>
    };<br>
    
    var newObj = new A();<br>
    
    newObj.doThing // this new object has this method because it's on A's prototype<br>
    so newObj.doThing is just like $(selector).tweet<br>
    
    Also feel free to read the source of jQuery and trace what happens when a new object is created. You can see near the top exactly what is happening under the comment // Define a local copy of jQuery<br>
